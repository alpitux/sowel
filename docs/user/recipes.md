# Recipes

Recipes are Sowel's answer to home automation **without scripting**. Each recipe is a reusable automation template: a thoughtful, road-tested pattern -- "Motion Light", "Presence Heater", "Pool Pump Schedule" -- that you drop onto a zone, fill in a few values, and let run.

You don't write code. You don't wire flows. You pick a recipe, configure its slots, and it works.

## What a recipe is

A recipe has two parts:

- A **definition** -- the template, written once by a recipe author and shipped as a plugin. It declares typed parameter **slots** (zone, equipments, durations, time windows, ...) and the behaviour to run when those slots are filled.
- An **instance** -- your application of the template. Each instance runs independently, with its own parameters and its own state.

You can have **multiple instances** of the same recipe. The same Motion Light pattern can run independently in your kitchen, your hallway, and your stairwell -- each with its own brightness setpoints and timeouts.

!!! info "A recipe instance is more than a script"
Behind the scenes, a recipe instance is a small running program that listens to the event bus, keeps state across restarts, and reacts in real time. You don't need to know any of that to use it.

## The catalogue

Sowel ships several recipes through the official plugin registry. New ones land regularly.

| Recipe                      | What it does                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Motion Light**            | Turns lights on for a fixed duration when motion is detected                                 |
| **Motion Light (Dimmable)** | Same, with brightness that adapts to time of day (3 brightness slots: day / evening / night) |
| **Switch Light**            | Lights follow manual button presses -- toggle on/off, with optional max-on failsafe          |
| **State-Triggered Light**   | Turns lights on when a watched equipment hits a target state (e.g. gate opens at night)      |
| **Presence Heater**         | Heats a room only when occupied, with day/evening/night setpoints and an away setback        |
| **Presence Thermostat**     | Same idea, for thermostats with a writable target temperature                                |
| **Auto Watering**           | Schedules irrigation by zone, with rain skip and weather-aware reduction                     |
| **Freecooling**             | Opens shutters or windows when outside is cooler than inside (and no rain in forecast)       |
| **Pool Pump Schedule**      | Runs the pool pump for a daily duration tied to water temperature                            |
| **State Watch**             | Monitors a data point and raises an alarm when it stays in a watched state too long          |

## Applying a recipe

Go to **Administration > Recipes** and click **Add Recipe**.

### Step 1: Pick a pattern

The catalogue shows everything installed locally. Each card displays the recipe name, what it does, and the parameters it needs.

### Step 2: Fill the slots

Slots are typed and validated. Depending on the recipe, you might be asked for:

| Slot type   | Example                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `zone`      | The room or area the recipe applies to                  |
| `equipment` | One or more equipments (filtered by required type)      |
| `duration`  | How long lights stay on after motion (e.g. `2m`, `15m`) |
| `time`      | A time of day (e.g. sunset, 22:00)                      |
| `number`    | A brightness, a temperature, a threshold                |
| `boolean`   | An on/off option                                        |

Sowel only shows you devices and equipments that are **compatible** with the slot. You can't bind a thermostat to a "lights" slot.

!!! tip "Most slots are pre-validated"
If a slot looks empty or wrong, the **Save** button stays disabled and the recipe explains what's missing.

### Step 3: Save and let it run

The instance starts as soon as you save. Toggle it on/off from the recipe list anytime. Open the instance to see its **log** -- a per-instance trace of what it has done and why.

## How recipes interact with [modes](modes.md)

Modes can flip recipes on or off as part of a single gesture. When you switch the house to **Night**, your "Motion Light" recipes can keep running but with the night brightness slot active; your "Auto Watering" can pause; your "Freecooling" can wake up.

A mode impact on a zone can do three things to a recipe instance:

- `recipe_toggle` -- enable or disable the instance
- `recipe_params` -- update its parameters (e.g. switch the brightness target)
- nothing -- leave it untouched

This is the glue that lets a recipe template behave differently across day / evening / night without you maintaining three separate instances.

## Why a recipe is not a script

In a typical hand-rolled setup, you write rules:

```yaml
- alias: kitchen_motion_light
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_motion
      to: "on"
  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: light.kitchen_spots
      data:
        brightness_pct: 80
```

Now multiply this by every room, every time-of-day variation, every "but only if no one is sleeping", every "except during dinner". You end up with hundreds of YAML rules glued together with templates and conditions. Adding a new room means rewriting the rules.

A recipe encodes the **complete pattern** -- including the edge cases that took the recipe author six months to get right. You set the brightness, the duration, the rooms; the recipe handles the rest. When you add a new room, you create a new instance of the same recipe -- not a new rule to maintain.

!!! example "What you don't have to think about"
Take **Motion Light (Dimmable)**. Out of the box, one recipe handles: multiple PIR sensors aggregated as a single signal, a brightness target that changes by time of day, manual brightness override detection (so dimming the light yourself doesn't get instantly overridden), a lux threshold (so it doesn't turn on at noon), button toggles to force-cancel, and recovery when the bridge reconnects after a Zigbee outage.

    You'd have spent a weekend hand-rolling that. The recipe ships with it.
